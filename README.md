# Portfolio (Unit 1 Project)

## Approach

1. Wireframes. One for small device, one for desktop. I'd share these drawings, but they're pretty bad.
2. Schedule. Breakdown what I'd like to accomplish each day so that I can track if I'm behind or on target.
3. First draft of HTML structure. Include anything hidden or later added.
4. UI research to get an idea of style, theme, colors, etc. Attempted a "modern" look.
5. Second draft of HTML structure. Refine and start commenting out what will be hidden or added via script.
6. FLEX TIME. Organize the HTML structure. Placeholder images, text, and styling used.
7. Nav(i) bar. This is central to the design so needs to be settled first. Make fully responsive.
8. Nail down general content styling. Try to carry theme throughout.
9. Build out carousel on Project page, make page responsive.
10. Start inserting content. Projects, Resume, About, and Home.
11. Add Contact modals and inputs (with Brendan's approval to not have a dedicated page).
12. Style polishing.
13. This readme.

## Three Points of Interaction

1. Contact info submission (and contact modal).
2. Project carousel.
3. Mobile view nav bar modal.

## Technologies Used

### HTML

1. Semantic markup.
2. Responsive design.

### CSS

1. Selectors (hover).
2. Flexbox layout method.
3. Responsive design.

### Javascript / jQuery

1. Event handler (on).
2. Incrementing through arrays.
3. Selecting and manipulating DOM elements.
4. Receiving/"storing" inputs in objects and arrays.

### Other

1. Netlify
2. ImageMagick
3. Imgur

## Unsolved Problems

1. Why does the About img sit on top of the contacts modal if I apply z-index of 100 to the _modal_ but works fine without a z-index. Discovered when using z-index on nav bar to hide ion-icons which were somehow sitting on top (but not their parent elements).
2. Why do the ion-icons go to the top of the screen while rest of section does not?
3. Swipe function for Projects page. Ran out of time.
